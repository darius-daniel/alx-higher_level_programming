## Mandatory Tasks

### Tasks:

#### 0. Squared simple:

**File:** `0-square_matrix_simple.py` - contains a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix

**Prototype:** `def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[])`

* `matrix` is a 2-dimensional array
* Returns a new matrix:

  * Same size as `matrix`
  * Each value should be the square of the value of the input
* Initial matrix should not be modified
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You are allowed to use regular loops, `map`, etc.


#### 1. Search and replace:

* **File:** `1-search_replace.py` - contains a function that replaces all the occurences of an element by another in a new list.
* **Prototype:** `def search-replace(my_list, search, replace):`
* `my_list` is the intitial list
* `search` is the element to replace in the list
* `replace` is the new element
* You are not allowed to import any module
